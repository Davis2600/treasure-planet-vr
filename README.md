A Virtual Reality experience I built for the 2022 Sigma Phi Epsilon Spring Carnival Booth. I built this game on the Unity Game engine, with Autohand for physics and hand interactions. James Gualtieri  helped out with modeling the Morph character. This project was built in a "hackathon-like" environment with only about a week or so of development time, so the codebase is quite messy.  

## Theme: Treasure Planet

A Disney Movie from 2002 in which Jim-Hawkins leaves his home to find the missing treasure from a dead space pirate. 

## Concept:


Build a simple VR game to immerse people in the treasure room from the Treasure Planet Movie. The gameplay is essentially a virtual reality shooting gallery or target practice. We wanted to place people onto treasure planet from the movie. This expereince was featured inside of the "treasure room" from the treasure planet booth.

## Targets:

* Put people in an immersive environment
* Enable people to use their hands to interact with a virtual environment
* Have Players experience presence in VR(character talking to them,and moving)
* Max 2 minute runtime

## Progression:
Players would put on the VR headset and were given controllers to interact with the world. After being explained the controls (grab middle finger, shoot index finger), individuals were prompted to press the red button to start the game. Once the game has started, an animated model of the robot would explain the controls of the game. After the robot finished giving exposition and instructions, the player was then prompted to press the red button in front of them once more. Upon pressing the button a second time, a blaster would spawn in, and the morph character would hide, and move from spot to spot. The player would look around to find Morph, then aim and shoot the blaster at his eyes popping out of the environment. When morph is found, he briefly pops out, before going to hide somewhere else. After one minute of this, the player is congratulated, and given a final score. The visual artifacts in the bellow video are from the Meta Quest 2's default screen capture implementation.

## Technology

The game ran standalone on an Oculus Quest 2 in the unity game engine. Most models were aquired from the asset store and modified in Blender. Morph was modeled, rigged, and animated by James Gualtieri. Sound effects were downloaded royalty free, or synthesized in Ableton Live. Jimmy Garcia voiced Ben the robot, and his performance was recorded in Ableton Live. 


## Succsess

* Game ran every day of carnival
* First VR experience for 500+ people
* Winning Booth in Fraternity Category!
