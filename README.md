# treasure-planet-vr
A Virtual Reality experience I built for the 2022 Sigma Phi Epsilon Spring Carnival Booth. 

# Theme: Treasure Planet
# Concept:
Build a simple VR game to immerse people in the treasure room from the Treasure Planet Movie. The gameplay is essentially a virtual reality shooting gallery or target practice.
# Targets:
– Put people in an immersive environment
– Enable people to use their hands to interact with a virtual environment
– Have Players experience presence in VR(character talking to them,and moving)
– Max 2 minute runtime
# Progression:
Players would put on the VR headset and were given controllers to interact with the world. After being explained the controls (grab middle finger, shoot index finger), individuals were prompted to press the red button to start the game. Once the game has started, an animated model of the robot would explain the controls of the game. After the robot finished giving exposition and instructions, the player was then prompted to press the red button in front of them once more. Upon pressing the button a second time, a blaster would spawn in, and the morph character would hide, and move from spot to spot. The player would look around to find Morph, then aim and shoot the blaster at his eyes popping out of the environment. When morph is found, he briefly pops out, before going to hide somewhere else. After one minute of this, the player is congratulated, and given a final score.
